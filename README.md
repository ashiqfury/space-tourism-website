## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Screenshot

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass (css preprocessor)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a lots of thing in responsive designs in this journey. I enjoyed build this website with transparent blured background and some animations.

### Continued development

I know there are some better ways to build this website. I may use some css frameworks like tailwind to reduce this complexity. I am sure, I will do some future projects using some frameworks. I did it with SASS and I will learn some more sass functions to make this code even better. ❤️
